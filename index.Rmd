<p class="intro">
As a Bahamian "sailor gal," I grew up spending all of my free time sailing or on a beach somewhere on my tiny island, Long Island. My childhood inspired my love for the ocean and has been a guiding force in my life.
</p>

<p class="intro">
My life and educational journey has led me to pursue a Ph.D. in Ocean Sciences at the University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science. My research focus is on sea level rise on the Florida and Bahamian coastlines.
