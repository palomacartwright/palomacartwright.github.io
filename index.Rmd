<p class="bio"> Paloma Cartwright completed her Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Environment at McGill University in June 2021. Growing up in The Bahamas, spending most of her days in or on
the ocean, her passion for nature developed from an early age. She also
experienced first hand the impacts of climate change on her home.
Throughout her undergraduate career, she completed internships with the
Bahamas Sea Turtle Research Institute and the Bimini Biological Field
Station Foundation - Sharklab studying varying species of marine life.
After graduation, Paloma seeked to bridge the gap between her two
disciplines and enrolled in the Master of Environmental Data Science
program at the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management. She
understands how both computer science and environmental disciplines will
be crucial to finding solutions for climate change impacts in The
Bahamas. Currently, her interests lie in renewable energy and climate
change mitigation. Her long-term goal is to use data science to advance
solutions to the environmental problems faced by The Bahamas.
