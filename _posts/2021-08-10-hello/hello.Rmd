This is the first blog post ever added to my website. It does not say very much because it is just a tester to demonstrate how distill websites work and how you create blog posts. As the quarter goes on, I will be adding more informational blog posts to my website. If you made it this deep, I hope you are enjoying my website. 
I am very new to making websites in RStudio using Distill, so please be patient with me as I work the kinks out over the next few months.
