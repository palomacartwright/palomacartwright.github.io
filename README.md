# Paloma's Personal Website

This is a repository containing the code for my personal website. It is a constant work in progress and I will continue to edit it as I go through my life. It is my hope that this continues to be my personal website long after I complete the Master of Environmental Data Science Program at Bren. 

Feel free to open an issue in this repo if you have an comments or suggestions or find something broken.
