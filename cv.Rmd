```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
library(tidyverse)
```

#### Adding in some stuff 
Added in a ggplot as a place holder using the diamonds dataset because I just want to practicing editing and stuff


```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = cut))
```
