      "contents": "\n\nPaloma Cartwright grew up on a small island in The Bahamas, where she spent most of her days on the ocean. She developed a passion for nature at an early age while also experiencing firsthand the impacts of climate change on her home, surviving yearly hurricanes and witnessing the constant depletion of marine ecosystems surrounding her island. To gain the skills to solve these issues, she headed to McGill University where she completed a BA in Computer Science and Environment in June 2021. Throughout her undergraduate career, she interned with the Bahamas Sea Turtle Research Institute and the Bimini Biological Field Station Foundation - Sharklab. This work inspired her to dive into data science to develop the skills to do more with environmental data. Paloma decided to bridge the gap between her disciplines and enrolled in the Master of Environmental Data Science program at the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management. Her primary interests lie in climate change adaptation and her long-term goal is to use data science to advance solutions to the environmental problems faced by The Bahamas.\n\n\nWhen Paloma is not at Bren working on her Master’s degree, you can find her on the ocean somewhere. Sailing has been a guiding force in her life since she was 5 years old and stepped in a Pram for the first time. She has been sailing since then and has gone on to compete for Team Bahamas in Optimist and Laser Class from 2010 to present. Most recently, Paloma embarked on an Olympic Campaign in a Nacra 17 with fellow Bahamian Paul deSouza. Their aim was to compete in the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris, France, but decided to pause the campaign due to Covid-19 health concerns. Thus, Paloma decided to attend the Bren School and complete her Master of Environmental Data Science.\n\n\n\n\n",

As I grow through my journey as a data scientist, I will update this periodically with whatever I see fit. Sometimes I’ll feature The Bahamas, other times it will be fun code, other times who knows, but welcome to this journey with me.\n\n\n\n\n",
