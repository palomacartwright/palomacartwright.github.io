She developed a passion for nature\nat an early age while also experiencing firsthand the impacts of climate\nchange on her home, surviving yearly hurricanes and witnessing the\nconstant depletion of marine ecosystems surrounding her island. To gain\nthe skills to solve these issues, she headed to McGill University where\nshe completed a BA in Computer Science and Environment in June 2021.\nThroughout her undergraduate career, she interned with the Bahamas Sea\nTurtle Research Institute and the Bimini Biological Field Station\nFoundation - Sharklab. This work inspired her to dive into data science\nto develop the skills to do more with environmental data.\n\nTurtle tagging with the Sea Turtle\nResearch Institute\nPaloma decided to bridge the gap between her disciplines and enrolled\nin the Master of Environmental Data Science program at the Bren School\nof Environmental Science and Management. Having completed her Master’s\ndegree, Paloma is now pursuing a Ph.D in Ocean Science at the University\nof Miami’s Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric and Earth Sciences.\nHer research under Dr. Lisa Beal focuses on understanding how the\nchanging ocean currents are impacting sea level rise and flooding events\nin Florida and The Bahamas. Her primary interests lie in climate change\nadaptation and she is using the skills gained in both her undergraduate\nand master’s degrees to study a topic that has very real impacts on her\nhome.\n\n\nWhen Paloma is not studying outside of SALT at Rosenstiel, you can\nfind her on the ocean somewhere. Sailing has been a guiding force in her\nlife since she was 5 years old and stepped in a Pram for the first time.\nShe has been sailing since then and has gone on to compete for Team\nBahamas in Optimist and Laser Class from 2010 to present. While she is\nnot sailing full time due to her studies, Paloma still finds time to be\noutside whether it is scuba diving or hanging on the beach with\nfriends.\n\nLaser Sailing\n\n\n",

As I grow through my journey as a data scientist, I\nwill update this periodically with whatever I see fit. Sometimes I’ll\nfeature The Bahamas, other times it will be fun code, other times who\nknows, but welcome to this journey with me.\n\n\n\n\n",
