Growing up in The Bahamas, I have witnessed first hand the devastating impacts of hurricanes on livelihoods throughout the country and have been an active participant in recovery efforts every time my island was struck. Natural disasters have massive economic and human costs and take a deep toll on growth prospects because reconstruction costs monopolize already scarce resources for health, education, and social spending, especially in developing countries (Ötker & Srinivasan, 2018).\nThere is existing research on the impact of hurricanes on GDP growth in the United States but this project will look specifically at The Bahamas. With the global changing climate and the continual impact of stronger hurricanes on Caribbean countries, answering this question can have important implications for the future of small island developing states like The Bahamas.\nData Collection and Tidying\nFor the analysis of this research question, data from the National Hurricane Center and The World Bank are being used.\nGDP Growth Data\nThe data for percentage of GDP Growth was collected from The World Bank Data Repository. This data covers annual percentage of GDP growth from 1961 to present for The Bahamas. The metadata containing information about calculations and sampling strategy can be found here.\nWorld Bank. (2021).

This dataset did not exist in csv format, so I looked through the yearly reports from 1960 to present and recorded all of the storms that impacted The Bahamas. I made note of the year each storm occurred, the name of the storm, the intensity and the number of islands in The Bahamas that were impacted by each storm. Because The Bahamas is an archipelago of 17 major islands, I wanted to note how many were impacted by each storm because that would be a metric that could possibly affect GDP growth. If there are multiple islands that need to be rebuilt, this would have a greater impact.\nIn creation of this dataset, I recorded storm intensity from 1 to 6, with 1 being Tropical Storms and 6 being a category 5 hurricane. The Saffir-Simpson Wind Scale considers a tropical storm anything with winds below 74mph (National Hurricane Center, 2021), but I know that these storm can still have damaging impacts on countries so I wanted to ensure they were included in the data to be analyzed for this question.\nData I/O, Tidying and Visualization\n\n\nShow code\n\nstorms <- read_csv(here(\"_posts\", \"2021-11-24-hurricanes-and-gdp-growth-in-the-bahamas\", \"final_proj_data\", \"bahamas_hurricanes.csv\")) \n\nyr_storms <- storms %>% \n  group_by(year) %>% \n  summarize(number = n(), \n            avg_strength = mean(category),\n            avg_numisland = mean(no_of_islands))\n\nyr_storms_summary <- yr_storms %>% \n  kable(\n    digits = 2,\n    col.names = c(\"Year\", \"Number of Storms\", \"Average Strength\", \"Average Number of Islands\"), \n    align = 'lccr',\n    caption = \"Bahamian Hurricane Summary Statistics 1960 - 2021\")\n\nyearly <- ggplot(data = yr_storms, aes(x = year, y = number)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"blue\") + \n  labs(x = \"Year\", \n       y = \"Number of Storms\", \n       title = \"Yearly Number of Storms to Impact the Bahamas\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\n\nintensity <- ggplot(data = yr_storms, aes(x = year, y = avg_strength)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"blue\") +\n  labs(x = \"Year\", \n       y = \"Average Intensity of Storms\", \n       title = \"Average Yearly Storm Intensity\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\n\nyr_storms_summary\n\n\n\nTable 1: Bahamian Hurricane Summary Statistics 1960 - 2021\n\n\nYear\n\n\nNumber of Storms\n\n\nAverage Strength\n\n\nAverage Number of Islands\n\n\n1960\n\n\n1\n\n\n4.00\n\n\n3.00\n\n\n1961\n\n\n1\n\n\n1.00\n\n\n4.00\n\n\n1963\n\n\n1\n\n\n3.00\n\n\n3.00\n\n\n1965\n\n\n1\n\n\n5.00\n\n\n2.00\n\n\n1966\n\n\n2\n\n\n3.50\n\n\n3.00\n\n\n1970\n\n\n1\n\n\n1.00\n\n\n1.00\n\n\n1972\n\n\n1\n\n\n1.00\n\n\n1.00\n\n\n1973\n\n\n1\n\n\n1.00\n\n\n3.00\n\n\n1979\n\n\n1\n\n\n3.00\n\n\n1.00\n\n\n1981\n\n\n3\n\n\n1.67\n\n\n2.67\n\n\n1984\n\n\n1\n\n\n1.00\n\n\n2.00\n\n\n1985\n\n\n2\n\n\n2.00\n\n\n2.00\n\n\n1987\n\n\n1\n\n\n1.00\n\n\n3.00\n\n\n1988\n\n\n1\n\n\n1.00\n\n\n2.00\n\n\n1991\n\n\n2\n\n\n1.00\n\n\n2.50\n\n\n1992\n\n\n1\n\n\n6.00\n\n\n6.00\n\n\n1995\n\n\n1\n\n\n3.00\n\n\n4.00\n\n\n1996\n\n\n2\n\n\n3.50\n\n\n1.50\n\n\n1998\n\n\n1\n\n\n5.00\n\n\n1.00\n\n\n1999\n\n\n4\n\n\n2.75\n\n\n2.75\n\n\n2001\n\n\n1\n\n\n5.00\n\n\n2.00\n\n\n2002\n\n\n1\n\n\n1.00\n\n\n2.00\n\n\n2003\n\n\n4\n\n\n2.50\n\n\n1.75\n\n\n2004\n\n\n2\n\n\n4.00\n\n\n10.50\n\n\n2005\n\n\n6\n\n\n1.83\n\n\n2.83\n\n\n2006\n\n\n1\n\n\n1.00\n\n\n2.00\n\n\n2007\n\n\n1\n\n\n2.00\n\n\n5.00\n\n\n2008\n\n\n3\n\n\n3.67\n\n\n1.67\n\n\n2010\n\n\n2\n\n\n1.00\n\n\n3.00\n\n\n2011\n\n\n3\n\n\n2.00\n\n\n4.00\n\n\n2012\n\n\n2\n\n\n3.00\n\n\n3.50\n\n\n2013\n\n\n1\n\n\n1.00\n\n\n2.00\n\n\n2014\n\n\n2\n\n\n1.50\n\n\n2.00\n\n\n2015\n\n\n2\n\n\n3.50\n\n\n4.50\n\n\n2016\n\n\n3\n\n\n2.67\n\n\n2.67\n\n\n2017\n\n\n3\n\n\n4.00\n\n\n3.00\n\n\n2018\n\n\n2\n\n\n1.50\n\n\n2.00\n\n\n2019\n\n\n2\n\n\n5.00\n\n\n2.50\n\n\n2020\n\n\n4\n\n\n1.50\n\n\n1.50\n\n\n2021\n\n\n1\n\n\n2.00\n\n\n1.00\n\n\nShow code\n\nyearly / intensity\n\n\n\n\nCombining the Datasets\nTo complete my analysis, I had to combine the GDP growth dataset with the Hurricane dataset.\n\n\nShow code\n\nhgdp <- full_join(gdp_growth, yr_storms, by = 'year')\n\n\n\nAnalysis Plan\nClearly describe your analysis plan.

    "contents": "\nOkay so if you’ve been on this blogging journey with me from the beginning, you’ll know this blog post started out as just a list of my favorite beaches. But, this left me feeling a bit unsatisfied lol. After all, I am a data science student so I should include data right? Right! So, I polled my family and friends from home and asked them to rank the beaches from their most to least favorites and I am now redoing this blog post including data analysis. Yay me!\nIf you don’t know my background, I grew up in a tiny island on The Bahamas, Long Island, with a population of a little over 3,000 people. There were definitely both perks and downfalls (hello climate change and hurricanes) of this, but one of my greatest pleasures of growing up there was the fact that there were endless beaches for me to explore always.\nBeing on the ocean is my happy place and completing my senior year of undergrad at McGill University online from home was an unexpected gift for that stage in my life. I also spent a ton of time with my family which I wouldn’t have had the opportunity to do otherwise.\nThis blog post will feature my top 5 beaches (with photos of course). There will also be a surprise appearance of my mom’s swimming piggies. I hope you enjoy!\n\n\n\nMaking the list to decide on my favorites was initially a hard process, but since then I have taken my bias out and the list will now be based on the 12 friends that completed my survey for me. So below I will do some fun data tidying and wrangling and see where the analysis goes from there.\nWrangling my data\nI needed to clean it up first and then I decided to rename all of the columns so that they were shorter and easier to use later in my code. I also created a tribble with the total rating for each beach and will use that for my ranking of the beaches.\n\n\nbeaches_data <- read_csv(here(\"_posts\", \"2021-10-14-best-beaches\",\"beaches.csv\")) %>% \n  clean_names() %>% \n  rename(\"lowes\" = \"rate_lowes_beach\", \n         \"conch_point\" = \"rate_conch_point_beach\",\n         \"sand_bars\" = \"rate_the_sand_bars\", \n         \"blue_hole\" = \"rate_deans_blue_hole\", \n         \"gordons\" = \"rate_gordons_beach\", \n         \"fave\" = \"name_your_favourite_beach\")\n\n\n\ntotals <- tribble(\n  ~beach, ~total,\n  \"Lowe's Beach\", sum(beaches_data$lowes),\n  \"Conch Point Beach\", sum(beaches_data$conch_point), \n  \"The Sand Bars\", sum(beaches_data$sand_bars),\n  \"Dean's Blue Hole\", sum(beaches_data$blue_hole),\n  \"Gordon's Beach\", sum(beaches_data$gordons)\n)\n\ntotals <- totals %>% \n  arrange(total)\n\n\n\nNumber 5\nThe award for the least favorite beach among my family and friends goes to Conch Point Beach.\n(I’m salty about this because Conch Point Deserves to be higher)\nThis beach admittedly has a weird name, but its just a beach named after the channel that it borders, Conch Point. This has always been a favorite place of mine, but now even more so since my parents worked with members of the community to build cabanas on the beach and my mom trained the pigs that now live on the beach and play with you.\n\n\n\nIt is just so stunningly perfect, year round. It is only accessible by boat so it means I get a beach and boat day in one and I just love that for me.\n\n\n\nNumber 4\nLet’s see what my family gave me this time! The number 4 winner goes to Dean’s Blue Hole\nThis one is very reasonable. She had to make the list because she is world famous. Every year there are countless world records broken here because the Blue Hole is over 600 feet deep. The perfect place for a free-diving competition or if you’re me, to get your scuba diving certification.\n\n\n\n(Third Picture above from Vertical Blue)\nIf you grew up on Long Island, then you also know this is a perfect place for a lil adrenaline rush from jumping off of the cliff into the Blue Hole, just like my cousin is doing in the picture. Definitely a must do if you ever go to Long Island.\n\n\n\nNumber 3\nGordon’s Beach\nOkay so my friends just have bad taste, sorry guys. This beach deserves number 1 every time. Gordon’s Beach is at the Southern most end of Long Island, right off the end of the road. Just miles of untouched beauty. Literally takes my breath away everytime I see it and I’ve been going here my entire life. She is a stunner and worth the drive every time!\n\n\n\nThe Runner Up\nWhat do we have here? The Sand Bars\nSo when I did my ranking, the sand bars were ranked lower because they are only above water at low tides and only accessible by boat, so you do really have to time it right. Apparently that is not a deterrent for anyone, including me and it is a treat because when you do time it right?? Absolute stunner! I love it at the sandbars. You really do be feeling like you in the middle of nowhere. (That last sentence was very Bahamian, I do not apologize.)\n\n\n\nI mean just look at the content!! She truly speaks for herself.\n\n\nThe Winner\nAnd the top award (which does not surprise me) goes to… Lowe’s Beach.\nThis one has been a family fave for as long as I have been alive. This was definitely the beach of my toddler years and I have fond memories of it. My aunt sent me the pictures of me below and told me I should recreate it now, I have yet to do it but it was taken on Lowe’s Beach. My mom always spent summers on the beach everyday with me, my big brother and all of the cousins that could fit in the car. This beach was also probably where I learnt to swim.\n\n\n\nThis is a view of the stunning beach from above. It is this little pool thing that has a reef at the entrance that water flows through and over but feels a lil safer for children because they can’t go into the ocean.\n\n\n\nAt certain times in the year, the sand at this beach also has a pink tint, 10/10 rating. I love going to the beach with my friends here and we always have a good time.\n\n\n\nNo filter on any of these pictures because The Bahamas is THAT girl.\nSo after asking my friends for a ranking, I figured it was time for me to create my first !!WORD CLOUD!! I asked them all to write in the name of their favorite beach, on the list or not so I could make a fun little word cloud.\nI had to do some fun wrangling to ensure that there was no duplicate stuff in my word clouds but it mostly went well. Shoutout to my classmates Scout and Juliet for doing a word cloud in the blog post about our summer courses, y’all truly made my life easier for this and figuring it all out.\n\n\nbeaches_data <- beaches_data %>% \n  mutate(fave = tolower(fave))\n\nbeaches <- data.frame(table(beaches_data$\"fave\"))\n\nbeaches_df <- as.data.frame.matrix(beaches)\n\nbeaches_cloud <- ggplot(beaches_df, aes(label = Var1, size = Freq, color = Var1)) +\n  geom_text_wordcloud() +\n  scale_size_area(max_size = 10) +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 25),\n        panel.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\")) +\n  labs(title = \"Beach Beach Baby\")\n\nbeaches_cloud\n\n\n\n\nAdmittedly, my word cloud is not very interesting butttt it’s something and it is telling me that I probably should’ve included The Cape Beach. Here is a picture of that beaut.\n\nHope reading this post made your day better!\n\n\n\n",

I don’t know where this journey will take me, but I figured that I’d make a blog post about my process as I make some cool maps and learn how to use tmap.\nMaking a basic map of New Zealand with tmap. The New Zealand object comes from the sf data\ntm_polygons() combines both tm_fill() and tm_borders() so map_nz1 and map_nz2 below are the same.\n\n\nShow code\n\nmap_nz1 <- tm_shape(nz) +\n  tm_fill() + \n  tm_borders() \n\nmap_nz2 <- tm_shape(nz) + tm_polygons()\nmap_nz2\n\n\n\n\nCombining multiple layers\ntm_raster() plots a raster layer and the argument alpha is the transparency of that layer\n\n\nShow code\n\nmap_nz3 <- map_nz2 + tm_shape(nz_elev) +\n  tm_raster(alpha = 0.7) \nmap_nz3\n\n\n\n\nNew Zealand water addition\n\n\nShow code\n\nnz_water <- st_union(nz) %>% #returns a single geometry with resolved boundaries\n  st_buffer(22200) %>% #computes a buffer around this geometry\n  st_cast(to = \"LINESTRING\") #cast geometry to another type\n\nmap_nz4 <- map_nz3 + \n  tm_shape(nz_water) + tm_lines()\nmap_nz4\n\n\n\n\nAdding the height element to the map of New Zealand\n\n\nShow code\n\nmap_nz5 <- map_nz4 + \n  tm_shape(nz_height) + tm_dots()\n\nmap_nz5\n\n\n\n\nTo combine different maps using tmap in a similar way as you would use patchwork in ggplot you do the following:\n\n\nShow code\n\ntmap_arrange(map_nz3, map_nz4, map_nz5)\n\n\n\n\ntmap aesthetics\nThe common aesthetics for fill and border layers are color col , transparency alpha , line width lwd and line typelty.\n\n\nShow code\n\nmap1 <- tm_shape(nz) + tm_fill(col = \"green\")\nmap2 <- tm_shape(nz) + tm_fill(col = \"red\", alpha = 0.5)\nmap3 <- tm_shape(nz) + tm_borders(col = \"darkgrey\")\nmap4 <- tm_shape(nz) + tm_borders(lwd = 2)\nmap5 <- tm_shape(nz) + tm_borders(lty = 3)\nmap6 <- tm_shape(nz) + tm_fill(col = \"green\", alpha = 0.5) +\n  tm_borders(col = \"darkgrey\", lwd = 2, lty = 3)\ntmap_arrange(map1, map2, map3, map4, map5, map6)\n\n\n\n\nYou cannot use a column name in tmap like you can in R to set the aesthetic of a variable like color, but instead you have to put it in quotations. You can treat plot the same way as you would R though. Hopefully, I am understanding this correctly.\n\n\nShow code\n\n# tm_shape(nz) + tm_fill(col = nz$Land_area) This line fails\nplot(st_geometry(nz), col = nz$Land_area) # This works because plot has the same functionality as R\n\n\n\nShow code\n\ntm_shape(nz) + tm_fill(col = \"Land_area\") #The color aesthetic has to be in quotes here \n\n\n\n\nTo add a title in the legend of the aesthetic you are using, you define this in the same place as you define the aesthetic. expression() is used in the commented seciton below to add the special script for the squared kilometers. If you do not need fancy text, you can just put your title in quotes.\n\n\nShow code\n\n#legend_title = expression(\"Area (km\"^2*\")\") \nlegend_title = \"Area in Kilometers Squared\"\nmap_nza = tm_shape(nz) +\n  tm_fill(col = \"Land_area\", title = legend_title) + tm_borders(lwd = 1.5)\nmap_nza\n\n\n\n\nColor Settings\n\n\nShow code\n\ntm_shape(nz) + tm_polygons(col = \"Median_income\")\n\n\n\nShow code\n\nbreaks = c(0, 3, 4, 5) * 10000\ntm_shape(nz) + tm_polygons(col = \"Median_income\", breaks = breaks)\n\n\n\nShow code\n\ntm_shape(nz) + tm_polygons(col = \"Median_income\", n = 10)\n\n\n\nShow code\n\ntm_shape(nz) + tm_polygons(col = \"Median_income\", palette = \"viridis\")\n\n\n\n\nThis is all the map work I’ve done for the day! Stay tuned, maybe there will be more.\n\n\n\n",
